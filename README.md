# Hashtags in Markdown notes for VSCode

The extenstion provides, what is stands for: `#tag` functionality in markdown files. ðŸ˜„
Inspiration comes from [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) and [Nested Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-nested-tags.vscode-nested-tags).

How does this extentions differ from them?
- Markdown Notes provides same hashtag functionality, but also includes [[wiki-links]]. Markdown-hashtags only provides hashtags, so you can combine with different extention, like [Markdown Memo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svsool.markdown-memo).
- Nested tags put hashtags in html comment and YAML front matter. Markdown-hastags provides similar experience as hashtags in any social networks.
